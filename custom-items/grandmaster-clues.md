# Grandmaster Clues

### Prerequisites

To complete a grandmaster clue you are required to have opened 100 master caskets. These can be bought from other players or collected by solving master clue scrolls. Master clue scrolls can be created by Watson by using the `/create item:Master clue quantity:[#]` command if you have the required lower-tier clue scrolls in your bank.

### Strategy

The most efficient and rewarding strategy when solving grandmaster clues is equipping full [clue hunter](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/equippables#clue-hunter-outfit), graceful, the Achievement Diary Cape and [Zippy](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/custom-items/pets#resource-gathering-and-loot-effecting-pets). This gives the maximum amount of boosts (not including clue score from completing grandmaster clues, which is roughly 60 clues completed for the full 10% boost.) totaling 30%. The Zippy pet, when equipped, has a 1/15 chance to double the caskets rewarded from your clue solving trip.

### Obtaining

Grandmaster Clues can be received from a wide range of content. The rates are not included here because they change often and vary greatly between sources. A list of common sources is as follows:
