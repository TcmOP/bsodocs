# Implings

On top of the regular Implings you can get, there are 4 more you can get in BSO:

**Infernal Impling:** (requires 94 hunter) Drops TzHaar-related items, 1 in 1 million chance of Uncut onyx

**Chimpling:** (requires 95 hunter and a magic banana) It can drop seeds, TMB's, GMC's, and the very rare monkey egg.\
A single magic banana is consumed per catch and can be obtained by casting the `/activities enchant name:Banana spell`. This requires a regular banana (which can be farmed or created by casting bones to bananas) and a special enchant banana spell scroll which can be obtained from the [Monkey Rumble minigame](https://bso-wiki.oldschool.gg/minigames/mad-marimbos-monkey-rumble).

**Eternal Impling:** (requires 99 hunter) Drops magic-related items (staves, runes, orbs) and grandmaster clues. 1 in 1 million chance of Eternal crystal. Eternal Implings use magic to make themselves invisible to hide, thus you can only catch them if you have a Vasa cloak in your bank or equipped.

**Mystery Impling:** (requires 105 hunter) Drops a tradeable/untradeable/pet/equippable mystery box, can drop a grandmaster clue and has a 1 in 1 million chance of dropping another mystery Impling jar.

You can view the collection log for Implings with `/cl name:Implings`.
