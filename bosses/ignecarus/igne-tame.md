# Igne Tame

Once you have received a Dragon Egg drop from Ignecarus, you can go about growing your own tame!

You can send the dragon tame out on PvM trips and it will get you loot.

Having an idle dragon tame gives a 20% reduction in log and ore cost at the [Baxtorian Bathhouses](../../minigames/baxtorian-bathhouses.md#boosts).

## Hatching the Tame

In order to hatch the tame you must build a nursery with `/nursery build`.\
You will need 105 Construction along with 200 elder planks, 10 marble blocks and 500 feathers to build the nursery.

Once the nursery is built you can then fuel the nursery with `/nursery fuel`\
Fuelling the nursery will require 2,500 elder logs and 10,000 coal.

Finally, once you have satisfied these requirements you can add your egg to the nursery with `/nursery add_egg item:Dragon egg`

The dragon tame will take 18.5 hours to hatch. Once hatched there is a 1/30 chance its a rare shiny dragon, which is increased by 3% with a Ring of luck equipped.

## Growth

It starts off as a baby, but grows from baby -> juvenile -> adult. At the adult stage, its the strongest. It grows up over time while doing PvM trips. You need to feed it raw food each time it goes on a trip.

When your tame hatches, their stats are decided. However, it doesn't reach its full potential until it's fully grown. You can calculate what max-stats your dragon will have by multiplying the baby stats by 3 (keeping in mind rounding up/down). This stat influences how fast it does PvM trips.

You can send the dragon tame on trips with `/tames kill [monster]`.

For more information on tame commands see [Tames](../../custom-items/tames.md)

## Boosts

You can feed the dragon tame certain items with `/tames feed [item]`\
**Note:** Feeding any other items (food included) will have no effect\\
