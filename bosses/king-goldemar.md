## Extra Information

Players can equip a Ring of Luck, obtained via Grandmaster Clue Scrolls, to increase the drop rate of receiving the Broken Dwarven warhammer drop. **Note: If Participating in a mass, only 1 member of the party needs to have a Ring of Luck equipped to receive the increased drop rate.**

It is recommended to Mass for the 1st 50kc as it reduces your death chance.
