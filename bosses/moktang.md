# Moktang

![](../.gitbook/assets/moritz-lacusteanu-golem-fire.jpg)

Moktang is a mining-skilling boss, made of rocks and lava. The boss is _created_ by you, by using a spell on rocks. You create 'Moktang totems' using rocky/magic materials and elder runes, and then you use the totems to summon the boss and fight it.

Moktang offers the claws frame, which allows you to upgrade the speed your tame can kill things. It also drops items to create volcanic pickaxes, the fastest and best pickaxes.
